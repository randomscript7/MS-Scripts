# spawnKill

### Stopping programs with ease
-----------------------------

spawnKill is a small collection of Powershell/Batch scripts built for Microsoft Windows 10/11. When set up, user-specified programs are monitored regularly via processCatcher and are shut down upon running killProcesses using SIGINT for graceful termination. The user also has the option to use runStartupPrograms to automatatically run both scripts at startup.
